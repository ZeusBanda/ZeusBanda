# Hey, I’m Zeus — welcome to my GitHub

I break things, take the pieces, and build them back stronger.

Cybersecurity isn’t just my job — it’s my hobby, my passion, and the way I think.

## About Me

I'm a cybersecurity professional with a foundation in **red teaming** and **incident response**.

In and outside of work, I build tools and run experiments to answer one big question:  
**“If a specific threat actor targeted our environment, how would our defenses hold up?”**

That curiosity drives everything I do — from automation and evasion to detection and response.  
This isn't just a career for me. It's what I do for fun.

## Current Goals

- Complete **GRTP**, **GXPN**, and **GDAT**  
- Build deeper red and blue team insight to support purple operations  
- Develop threat intel and red team automation tooling  
- Become a trusted mentor and community contributor

## Featured Project

### [RankedCyberNewsAggregator (RCNA)](https://github.com/ZeusBanda/RankedCyberNewsAggregator)
*A Python tool for aggregating and scoring cybersecurity news and threat intelligence — tailored for operational relevance.*

RCNA was built out of necessity: trying to cut through the noise and quickly figure out which cyber stories actually matter. Its scoring engine prioritizes articles based on custom keywords, threat relevance, and context — so you can focus on what’s high-impact, not just what’s trending.

Originally tuned for ICS/OT environments, it’s flexible enough to support any niche or industry.
